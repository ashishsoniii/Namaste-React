import React from 'react'

    // React.createElement('h1', null, 'App') is objet -> it renders -> and then we got htmlElement()
    

    // JSX - is not HTML in js - it merges HTML and JS together 
    // React and jsx is different 
    // JSX is html like syntax (liiks like html, xml)  but it is transformed into regular javascript object by babel or typescript compiler
    
    
    // code is written for both human and computer 
    // first for humans bcz they read and then for computer
    
    // js engine understand ES6 
    // JSX is not understood by js engine
    // so we need to convert JSX into js object
    // Babel is a tool that converts JSX into js object
    // Babel is a transpiler
    // Babel is a compiler
    // Babel is a source-to-source compiler
    
    // JSX is transpiled before it reaches the JS engine

    
    // babel understand JSX and babel converts JSX into js object (readable by react)

    // JSX -> Babel  -> React.createElement -> JS object -> HTML element
  
  
  
  
  
  // React Components
  // React components are the building blocks of any React application
  // 2 types of componennts in react -  class based (old way) , functional components;
  
  // React Functional component - returns jsx code
